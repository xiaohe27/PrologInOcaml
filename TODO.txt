We've known that subst function is a map from string to term.
Achieved:
1. Impl the subst func such that given a subst function and a var, it can return the term after substitution.

2. Extend the subst func such that given a subst function and a term, it can return the new term where each var has been substituted by its corresponding term in the subst function.


ToDo if have time:
string concat: 3 args op
