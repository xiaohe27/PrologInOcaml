There are several editions of prolog currently available online: SWI-prolog\cite{swi}, GNU-prolog\cite{gprolog}, Amzi-prolog\cite{amzi}, and so on.

The BNF grammar describing the acceptable input to our Prolog simulator is a core edition\cite{prologBNF} of the most basic prolog, so it is safe to start here.
